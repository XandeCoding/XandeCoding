# About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m Alexandre, but you can call me Ale.
I work as a back-end developer, but what I really enjoy is using technology as a bridge between people and solutions. After all, good technology is the kind that makes life easier, right?

As for my experience, Iâ€™ve worked at SaaS startups and at a payment institution, where I developed tools focused on the developer experience â€” such as logs, metrics, incident alerts, and internal audits.

Currently, Iâ€™m part of the LuizaLabs team, the tech arm of the Magazine Luiza Group, focused on innovation and technology. There, I help deliver modern, efficient solutions to Brazilian retail.

My main programming languages are TypeScript and Python, and Iâ€™ve worked with frameworks like Express, Fastify, Flask, and FastAPI.
I also have experience with cloud, working with AWS and GCP, using tools like Kubernetes and serverless functions.
